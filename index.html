                    "question": "What does locking a car/map actually prevent?",
                    "answer": "Locking your mod prevents it from being hosted on unlicensed servers. If someone tries, the game will freeze or crash. Players can still use your content in singleplayer without any issues."
                },
                {
                    "question": "Can locked content still be stolen or cracked?",
                    "answer": "Locking also encrypts your files using CSP's system. As long as CSP's encryption holds, your content is safe from extraction or tampering. Nothing is 100% uncrackable, but this protection should last longer than you probably care."
                },
                {
                    "question": "How many servers can use my locked content?",
                    "answer": "As many as you wish. Currently we hardcode a list of authorized server IP and ports into the locked files. You can provide me with a list of servers that are allowed to use your content, and I will include them when locking. If you need to add or remove servers, the maps have to be locked again with a new set of servers. We are working on a Key-System that will allow you to manage authorized servers yourself, but it is not ready yet."

                    "question": "What versions of Assetto Corsa / CSP are supported?",

                    "question": "Will encryption affect game performance?",

                    "question": "Can I unlock or update my content later?",
                    "answer": "Once locked, the files cannot be edited. To make updates, you must use your original files and lock them again (I do not offer updates, re-locking your content means purchasing the service again). Always keep a safe copy of your original work."
                },
                {
                    "question": "What happens if I lose my original unlocked files?",
                    "answer": "Then your work is gone for good. A locked file cannot be unlocked or recovered. Please keep backups of your original files in a safe place."
                },
                {
                    "question": "Do you provide updates if CSP/AC changes break something?",
                    "answer": "I will do my best to help. It is very unlikely that a CSP or AC update will break encryption since it would affect thousands of mods. If it ever happens, I will try to provide a fix."
